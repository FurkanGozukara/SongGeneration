  "lyrics": "[intro-short]\n\n[verse]\nI've been walking through the shadows of my mind\nSearching for the words I couldn't find\nEvery heartbeat echoes in the dark\nWaiting for a flame to light the spark\n\n[chorus]\nBut I'm still breathing, still believing\nThat tomorrow brings a brand new start\nI'm still fighting, still surviving\nWith the fire burning in my heart\n\n[verse]\nAll the broken pieces on the floor\nTell the story of who I was before\nNow I'm standing stronger than I knew\nRising from the ashes, breaking through\n\n[chorus]\nBut I'm still breathing, still believing\nThat tomorrow brings a brand new start\nI'm still fighting, still surviving\nWith the fire burning in my heart\n\n[bridge]\nWhen the world gets heavy\nI won't let it break me down\nI'll keep moving steady\nTill I turn it all around\n\n[chorus]\nYeah I'm still breathing, still believing\nThat tomorrow brings a brand new start\nI'm still fighting, still surviving\nWith the fire burning in my heart\n\n[instrumental]\n\n[outro-long]",
